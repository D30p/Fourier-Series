# Fourier-Series
Code for Fourier Series Analysis

This code is for homework and it might still lack some function, further, better code can be developed from this version, but at least it should be enough to give enough information usually asked in solving fourier series related problem.

**There are two version of the code**
1. Version 1 is for general problem solving
2. Version 2 is for odd and even problem solving

**In this repository**
1. What I've done manually
2. The code
3. Additional Geogebra Graph for Further Analysis

Have a nice day ^_^
